# Portfolio_Projects

1) The first project here is a SQL project on covid data. I seeked to answer multiple questions like:

  a) Whats the likehihood of death if you get covid in USA?
  b) What percentage of population got covid in USA?
  c) What countries have the highest infection rate? 
  d) Rolling population in each country that got vaccinated and so on.
  
  This project shows my proficiiency to write basic SQL queries with use of CTE and more complex functions like PARTITION BY.
  Please check the covid_sql_project.pdf to see all the exhaustive queries.
