# Portfolio_Projects

1) The first project here is a SQL project on covid data. I seeked to answer multiple questions like:

    a) Whats the likehihood of death if you get covid in USA?

    b) What percentage of population got covid in USA?

    c) What countries have the highest infection rate? 

    d) Rolling population in each country that got vaccinated and so on.
  
  This project shows my proficiiency to write basic SQL queries with use of CTE and more complex functions like PARTITION BY.
  
  Please check the covid_sql_project.pdf to see all the exhaustive queries.  
    
      
      
2) The second SQL project is on data cleaning via SQL. I performed operation to:

    a) Convert the datetime format to date and update the table.

    b) Populate the property addresses using SELF JOIN.

    c) Break out addresses into address, city and state columns using both SUBSTRING and PARSENAME.

    d) Multiple entries in the table were Y and N instead of Yes and No. Changed Y and N to Yes and No using CASE statements.
    
    e) Removed duplicates using CTE.
    
    f) Deleted unused columns from the table.
  
  This project shows my proficiiency to write SQL queries to clean data and make it more usable.
  
  Please check the data_cleaning.sql to see all the exhaustive queries.
  
  3) The thiird project here is on understanding the crime in chcago. I used chicago_crime data from bigquery_public_data for this study. I wanted to answer primarily these questions:
  
    a) Has crime increased year over year?
    b) Is there a particular month that has more crime?
    c) What are the top 10 type of crimes in last 22 years?
    d) Is there any district with more crime than others?
    e) What was the percentage of theft year over year?

The Sql queries i used are in the sql_queries file.

I generated the following plots in tableau to explain the results.
