## Foodie-Fi SQL Project

This project is part of **Danny Ma’s 8-Week SQL Challenge**. Danny and his team launched a streaming startup called **Foodie-Fi** in 2020, offering monthly and annual subscription plans that give users unlimited access to premium food content from around the world.

This case study focuses on analyzing subscription-style digital data to gain insights into **business performance, customer lifecycle, and payment behavior**.


### Key Questions Answered:

1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan `start_date` values (grouped by month)?
3. What plan `start_date` values occurred after 2020, and how are they distributed by `plan_name`?
4. What is the count and percentage of customers who have churned (rounded to 1 decimal place)?
5. How many customers churned immediately after their trial, and what is that percentage (rounded to the nearest whole number)?
6. What is the count and percentage of customer plans after their trial?
7. What is the customer count and breakdown by plan type as of `2020-12-31`?
8. How many customers upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
9. On average, how many days does it take for a customer to upgrade to an annual plan from the day they joined?
10. Can we break this average upgrade time into 30-day buckets (0–30, 31–60, etc)?
11. How many customers downgraded from a **pro monthly** to a **basic monthly** plan in 2020?
12. How would you calculate the **rate of growth** for Foodie-Fi?

This project highlights my ability to analyze **subscription funnels, customer churn, lifecycle transitions**, and interpret data in a way that directly supports business decisions.
