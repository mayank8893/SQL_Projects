## Data Bank SQL Project

This project is from Week 4 of **Danny Maâ€™s 8-Week SQL Challenge**. In this case study, we explore a fictional digital banking platform called **Data Bank**, where customers are allocated cloud data storage based on their account balances.

The business goal is to track customer activity and storage usage in order to better **forecast future growth** and support strategic decisions.

2. What is the number of nodes per region?
3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
5. What is the median, 80th, and 95th percentile of reallocation days per region?
6. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
7. What is the average total historical deposit count and amount for all customers?
8. For each month, how many customers made **more than 1 deposit** and **at least 1 purchase or withdrawal**?
9. What is the **closing balance** for each customer at the end of the month?

This project demonstrates my ability to perform analytical SQL involving **percentile calculations, subqueries, aggregation, filtering by business logic**, and deriving customer-level insights to support product and business decisions.
