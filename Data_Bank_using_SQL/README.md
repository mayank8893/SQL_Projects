# Data_Bank_using_SQL

This project is from week-4 of Danny Ma's * week SQL challenge. Danny has launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs banking activities. Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts.

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need. This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

2. What is the number of nodes per region?
3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
6. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
7. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
8. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
9. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
10. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?
