# Dannys_diner_using_SQL

For this SQL project I am using the famous Danny's Diner schema. This schema consists of three tables: sales containing customer_id, order_date and product_id info, members containing customer_id, join_date info and menu containing product_id, product_name and price info.

Based on these three tables, I have answerd the foloowing questions by writing queries in BigQuery:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member.
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member.
8. What is the total amount and total items for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equals to 10 points and sushi has a 2x multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

Please see sql_week1.pdf for all the queries.
