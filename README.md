# SQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **SQL Projects** repository! This collection showcases various data analysis and transformation projects I've worked on using **Google BigQuery** and **Azure Data Studio**.

Each project demonstrates practical SQL skills: from data cleaning and joins to advanced queries using CTEs, window functions, and performance optimization.



## What’s Inside

- **Organized by Project**  
  Navigate through the folders to find individual projects, each with its own dataset, queries, and problem statement.
- **Tools Used**  
  - Google BigQuery  
  - Azure Data Studio  
  - PostgreSQL / T‑SQL syntax  

- **Detailed Instructions**  
  Every project contains its own `README.md` with context, setup steps, and query explanations.



## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning & filtering  
- Aggregations & subqueries  
- CTEs & window functions  
- Joins & set operations  
- Analytical problem solving  
- Performance tuning
