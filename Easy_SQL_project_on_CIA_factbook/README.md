# SQL Project: CIA World Factbook Analysis

This project explores demographic and geographic data from the **CIA World Factbook**, a comprehensive resource containing statistics for countries around the world. The dataset includes key metrics such as:

- Total population  
- Population growth rate  
- Land area  

Using **Google BigQuery**, I wrote a series of SQL queries to analyze and draw insights from this dataset. The goal was to answer questions related to population trends, density, and migration patterns across countries.

### Key Questions Explored

1. Which countries have the highest and lowest population?
2. Which countries have the highest and lowest population growth rates?
3. What are the 10 least and most populated countries?
4. What is the average population and land area across all countries?
5. Which countries are densely populated (i.e., high population and small area)?
6. What are the top 10 most densely populated countries?
7. Which country has the highest growth rate vs. the largest population?
8. Which countries have a higher birth rate than death rate?
9. Which countries are projected to add the most people in the coming year?
10. Which countries have the highest net migration rates?

### Outputs

All SQL queries and results are included in the file **`cia_factbook_sql.pdf`**.

### Summary

This was a straightforward yet insightful project to practice writing SQL queries for real-world datasets. It provided hands-on experience working with aggregate functions, filtering logic, and basic data exploration in **BigQuery**.
