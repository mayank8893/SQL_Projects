# Easy_SQL_project_on_CIA_factbook

This project used CIA World Factbook data which is a compendium of statistics of all the countries on earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:
* Population
* Population Growth rate
* Area

SQL queries were then written to answer the following questions from the data:
1) Which country has the maximum, minimum population? Which country has the maximum/minimum population growth rate?
2) Which 10 countries have the least population?
3) Which 10 countries have the highest population?
4) Calculate the average population and area.
5) Find out which countries are densely populated by selecting countries with above average population and below average area.
6) Which 10 countries are the most densely populated?
7) Which country had the max population and which has max popilation growth rate?
8) Which countries have higher birth rate than death rate?
9) Which countries will add the most people to their population in thee next year?
10) Which countries have the highest migration rate?

Please see the cia_factbook_sql.pdf to all the exhaustive queries. Overall, this was a very easy project using SQL and done on BigQuery platform.
